# Machine Learning Neural Networks
Overview of Machine Learning in Neural Networks from [3BLUE1BROWN](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi) YouTube series.

These documents give an overview of the following topics:
1. Defining a Neural Network.
2. Basic underlying principle in a classical Neural Network - Gradient Descent Algorithm.
3. Effectively finding the Gradient for the Gradient Descent Algorithm of a Neural Network - Backpropagation.
4. Calculus in Backpropagation of a Feed Forward Neural Network.
